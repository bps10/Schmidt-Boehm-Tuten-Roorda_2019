This repo contains the raw data and analyses presented in:

[Brian P. Schmidt](https://bps10.github.io), Alexandra E. Boehm, William S. Tuten, Austin Roorda. _Spatial summation of individual cones in human color vision'_ 

All analyses were conducted in the R programming language. Stylized versions of the scripts are linked below. The files ending in `.Rmd` are the raw R notebook files. Scripts should be run in the order they are numbered.

1. [01_Process-Data.nb.html](01_Process-Data.nb.html) takes the raw data in [all_trial_data.csv](all_trial_data.csv) and does some light filtering and sanity checking. The output of this script is [filtered_data.csv](filtered_data.csv).

2. [02_Analyze-Data.nb.html](02_Analyze-Data.nb.html) contains the analyzes that are described in the manuscript.
